## Types of Neural Networks
**Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**: This is the simplest form of neural network where information travels in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer, without forming cycles.

**Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: A type of feedforward neural network with multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. It is widely used for supervised learning tasks.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Specifically designed for image processing and recognition, CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.

**Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Suited for sequential data, RNNs have connections that create cycles, allowing information to be passed from one step to the next. They are used in tasks like natural language processing and time series analysis.

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A specialized type of RNN designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, making it more effective for learning long-term dependencies.

**Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**: Similar to LSTM, GRUs are a type of RNN designed to capture long-term dependencies with fewer parameters.

**Autoencoder**: An unsupervised learning model used for data compression and feature learning. It consists of an encoder to map input data to a compressed representation and a decoder to reconstruct the input.

**Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: An extension of autoencoders that models the distribution of the data in the latent space, allowing for generating new samples.

**Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: Comprising a generator and a discriminator, GANs are used for generating new data samples. The generator tries to create realistic data, and the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated samples.

**Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)**: A type of neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. It is often employed for pattern recognition and interpolation tasks.

**Hopfield Network**: A type of recurrent neural network used for associative memory and pattern recognition. It is characterized by fully connected neurons with symmetric weights.

**Boltzmann Machine**: A type of stochastic recurrent neural network used for unsupervised learning. It consists of visible and hidden layers, and learning occurs through a process of adjusting weights to model the distribution of training data.

**Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**: An unsupervised learning algorithm used for dimensionality reduction and clustering. It organizes data in a grid-like structure, preserving the topological relationships of input data.

**Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN)**: An extension of the RBFN that includes a probabilistic layer for classification tasks.

**Echo State Network (ESN)**: A type of recurrent neural network with fixed random weights in the hidden layer, often used for time-series prediction.

**Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (HRNN)**: Designed to capture hierarchical relationships in sequential data, HRNNs have multiple layers of RNNs.

**Neuromorphic Networks**: Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, neuromorphic networks attempt to mimic biological neurons and synapses, emphasizing energy efficiency and parallel processing.

**Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)**: A type of neural network architecture designed for sequence modeling, utilizing temporal convolutional layers.

**Capsule Network (CapsNet)**: An architecture designed to overcome some limitations of traditional convolutional neural networks, particularly in recognizing spatial hierarchies.
